<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is a music app made by our group which has extended the features of the music app project the students made with the help and guidance of the team of Brainmentors Pvt. Ltd. The project now has well defined routes, a better User Interface, Admin Dashboard and Admin Features like Add A song, Delete a song. We have also made use of an npm package for the audio player in the All Songs Page. There has been an extensive use of React Router Dom in this application as well as the usage of local Api also has been alot which has also been extended to provide the features of reading the list of songs,adding a song and deleting a song. There is a lot of scope of improvement and the project can be made better with adding more number of features.
