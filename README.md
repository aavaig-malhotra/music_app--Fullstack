<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is a music app made by our group which has extended the features of the music app project the students made with the help and guidance of the team of Brainmentors Pvt. Ltd. The project now has well defined routes, a better User Interface, Admin Dashboard and Admin Features like Add A song, Delete a song. We have also made use of an npm package for the audio player in the All Songs Page. There has been an extensive use of React Router Dom in this application as well as of the local Api which has been extended to provide the features of reading the list of songs,adding a song and deleting a song. The app can be improved by adding more features.
I would like to thank our college Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering and Brainmentors Pvt. Ltd. for providing us with the opportunity to enhance our skills through this 4-week long training in Full Stack Web Development
